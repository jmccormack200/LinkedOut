# LinkedOut

LinkedIn is a necessary evil. There's no better job search engine, and no worse social media platform. Take charge of your career search and block out the self-promoting thought leaders and ChatGPT Listicles with this chrome extension.

When activated, the "feed" page of LinkedIn is blocked so you don't have to hear about how a CEO 10x'd their company by waking up at 4 am and eating nothing but egg whites for 30 days.

Say goodbye to the noise and hello to a more streamlined LinkedIn.
